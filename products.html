    <!-- Product 1 -->
    <h3>iPad Mini Air R1600</h3>
    <p>Description of product.
        Product Title: iPad Mini Air – Student Priced, R1600 Only

Description:
Yo, what’s up. I’m Tino, broke college kid extraordinaire. Tuition’s due, textbooks cost more than rent, and last night I realized instant noodles don’t count as a food group. So… I’m letting go of my iPad Mini Air for just R1600.

It’s light, fast, and perfect for notes, Netflix, or pretending you’re studying when you’re really just scrolling TikTok in lecture. Battery life is solid (better than my attention span), screen is crisp, and it fits in your bag without making you look like you’re lugging around a laptop from 2004.

I’d keep it, but R1600 buys me groceries, data, and maybe a weekend with electricity (thanks, load shedding). So don’t think too hard — grab this steal before I change my mind and try to eat it for dinner.

Condition: Gently used, no cracks, no scratches, just pure vibes.

Price: R1600 (because that’s exactly how much my campus coffee debt is).

    <h3>2024 KTM 85 Mini Bike R900</h3>
    <p>Description of product.
        Product Title: 2024 KTM 85 Mini Bike – R64999 Value, Letting It Go for R900

Description:
Hi. My name’s Samantha and I’m mad. My big brother thinks he’s soooo cool with his expensive KTM 85 mini bike, but he broke my dollhouse — MY dollhouse!  So guess what? I’m selling his “precious baby” right here.

It’s a 2024 KTM 85, worth R64,999 (yes, I peeked at his receipts), but I only need R900 to buy myself the biggest, best dollhouse in the shop. That’s right — R900, take it or leave it.

The bike is basically brand new, he only rides it when he wants to show off to his friends. It’s fast, shiny, and loud. But I don’t care. He should’ve thought about that before smashing Barbie’s living room.

So if you want a crazy deal and to make my brother cry, buy it quick. First come, first served. 

Condition: Perfect. (Unlike my brother’s attitude.)

Price: R900 (non-negotiable, because I already picked out my new dollhouse).

    <h3>Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Best offer</h3>
    <p>Description of product.
        Product Title: Antique Pocket Watch – Passed Down, Ready to Cash Out


Hey, name’s Ricky “Two Chips” Malone. I’m a young man with a taste for the dice table and a shortage of luck (so far). I’m letting go of my great-great-grandfather’s pocket watch — a real vintage piece that’s been keeping time longer than I’ve been making bad decisions.

This watch has history: it’s seen world wars, prohibition, and probably a few backroom poker games my ancestors didn’t tell the church about. The brass casing still shines up nice, and the tick-tock? Smooth like a jazz band on a Friday night.

I hate to part with it, but, you know, a man’s gotta fund his next big win. If you’ve got an eye for antiques (or just want to flex on your wrist like an old-school boss), this is your chance.

Condition: A little worn (just like me after a night at the casino), but still classy and functional.

Price: Best offer — preferably before the weekend, so I can put it all on black.
